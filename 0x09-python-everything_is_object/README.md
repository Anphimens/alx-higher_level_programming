# Python - Everything is object


## Introduction
Welcome to the world of Python programming! One of the fundamental principles that sets Python apart is the concept that everything in Python is an object. This concept is deeply in the language's object-oriented nature, making Python versatile and powerful.


## What is an Object?
In Python, an object is a fundamental building block. It represents a real-world entity or concept and encapsulates data (attributes) and the functions that operate on the data (methods). Objects can be as simple as numbers or as complex as entire software systems

## Class vs. Object or Instance
- Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods.
* Object or instance: A specific realization of a class. It is created from the class and represents a unique entity with its own set of attributes and methods.

## Immutable vs. Mutable Objects
- Mutable Object: Can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries).

- Immutable Object: Cannot be changed after creation (e.g., strings, tuples).

## Variables and References
- Reference: Variables in Python are references to objects, not containers for values.

* Alias: Two or more variables can refer to the same object, creating an alias. Changes through one alias affect others.

# Identical Variables vs. Linked to the Same Object
- Identical Variables: Checked using the `is` keyword. Two variables are identical if they reference the same object.

- Linked to the Same Object: Checked using the `==` operator. Two variables reference the same object.


## Requirements
## Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
+ All your files should end with a newline character
- The first line of all your script files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3


## `.txt` Answer Files
+ Only one line
* No Shebang
- All your files should end with a new line
